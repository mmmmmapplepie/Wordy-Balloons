  - word: Shall
    description:
    - To owe; to be under obligation for.
    - To be obliged; must.
    - As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation is derived
      from the person speaking; as, you shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or
      promise your going. It thus ordinarily expresses, in the second and third persons,
      a command, a threat, or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command
      is made more imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is
      also employed in the language of prophecy; as, "the day shall come when . .
      . , " since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide
      in significance. In shall with the first person, the necessity of the action
      is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than in the speaker; as, I shall
      suffer; we shall see; and there is always a less distinct and positive assertion
      of his volition than is indicated by will. "I shall go" implies nearly a simple
      futurity; more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which,
      naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize
      the shall, and the event is described as certain to occur, and the expression
      approximates in meaning to our emphatic "I will go." In a question, the relation
      of speaker and source of obligation is of course transferred to the person
      addressed; as, "Shall you go?" (answer, "I shall go"); "Shall he go?" i. e.,
      "Do you require or promise his going?" (answer, "He shall go".) The same relation
      is transferred to either second or third person in such phrases as "You say,
      or think, you shall go;" "He says, or thinks, he shall go." After a conditional
      conjunction (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express futurity
      simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are right. Should is everywhere
      used in the same connection and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect.
      It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it whether he
      will or not. In the early English, and hence in our English Bible, shall is
      the auxiliary mainly used, in all the persons, to express simple futurity.
      (Cf. Will, v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically; thus, with an adverb or other
      word expressive of motion go may be omitted.

    description:
    - See under Compound, v. t.
    - The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival, motion made in
      the direction of a place or thing and attaining it, access; and also, motion
      or tendency without arrival; movement toward; -- opposed to from.

      or action; as, he is going to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.
    - In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of application, to connects
      transitive verbs with their remoter or indirect object, and adjectives, nouns,

      or appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let
      us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful
      to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous liquor.

      a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to go, i.e., ready unto going; good
      to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But
      it has come to be the almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations
      where it has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object
      or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's
      country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the infinitive denotes
      the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed the prefixing of for to
      the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt. xi. 8).
    - In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a pregnant
      meaning, or is used elliptically.
